## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lysagxra/HanimeDownloader.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd HanimeDownloader
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Single Episode Download

To download a single hanime episode from an URL, you can use `hanime_downloader.py`, running the script with a valid album URL.

### Usage

```bash
python3 hanime_downloader.py <episode_url>
```

### Example

```
python3 hanime_downloader.py https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/sukebe-elf-tanbouki-1
```

## Hanime Series Download

To download all the episodes from a hanime series, you can use `hanime_downloader.py`, running the script with a valid album URL, and `--all-episodes` command-line argument:

```bash
python3 hanime_downloader.py <episode_url> --all-episodes
```

### Example

```
python3 hanime_downloader.py https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/sukebe-elf-tanbouki-2 --all-episodes
```

## Batch Download

To batch download from multiple album URLs, you can use the `main.py` script. This script reads URLs from a file named `URLs.txt` and downloads each one using the album downloader.

### Usage

1. Create a file named `URLs.txt` in the root of your project, listing each URL on a new line.

You can provide custom path to `URLs.txt` file via --urls flag.

- Example of `URLs.txt`:

```
https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/sukebe-elf-tanbouki-1
https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/sukebe-elf-tanbouki-2
https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/youkoso-sukebe-elf-no-mori-e-2
```

- Ensure that each URL is on its own line without any extra spaces.
- You can add as many URLs as you need, following the same format.

2. Run the batch download script:

```
python3 main.py
```

3. The downloaded files will be saved in the `Downloads` directory.

## Custom Resolution

To download an episode (or all episodes in a session) in a certain resolution, you can use the `--resolution` command-line argument:

```bash
python3 hanime_downloader.py <episode_url> --resolution <resolution>
```

or

```bash
python3 main.py --resolution <resolution>
```

### Example

```
python3 hanime_downloader.py https://hanime.tv/videos/hentai/sukebe-elf-tanbouki-1 --resolution 480p
```

If not specified, the program will automatically select `720p` as the default resolution. The supported resolutions are: `360p`, `480p`, and `720p`.

## Logging

The application logs any issues encountered during the download process.
